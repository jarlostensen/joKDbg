# joKDbg - Work In Progress
A basic serial debugger for my kernel projects.<br/>

I have decided to write my kernel on Windows which limits the available support for debugging so I've decided to try to write my own.
Python is a great language to use for this, not the least because of the many out-of-the-box libraries available and the rapid speed of iteration.

I'm using https://github.com/moyix/pdbparse for example, which saves me a lot of time and effort.
